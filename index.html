  <div><p>In Sublime, make some changes to your index.html file, and give it some styles in your style.css. If you need ideas you can add additional sections, start playing with colors, and maybe even GOOGLE some other fun features you often see on websites like nav bars, footers, and hero sections.  REMEMBER: GOOGLE IS YOUR FRIEND! GOOGLE EVERYTHING THAT MAKES YOU GO "HMMM....?"</p> </div>
